## Ingredients:

- Pumpkin or squash of your choice. Personally I like buttercup squash (not to be confused with butternut squash. Buttercup is the short green one, butternut is the tall orange one). You'll want about half a medium buttercup or equivalent.
- 1 can of coconut cream
- 1 onion or 2 shallots (or 1 onion, 1 shallot, whatever)
- 3 cloves of garlic
- Fresh ginger to taste (I use about 3cm)
- Sriracha sauce to taste (I use a few tablespoons)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Oil
- Optional -- a stick of lemongrass and fresh chilli. Coriander for garnish.


## Make the thing:
- Chop onion, mince garlic and ginger. If using, smash up the lemongrass a bit.
- Chop pumpkin into 2-3cm cubes (remove skin and seeds). Optionally, you can roast the pumpkin and then just scoop out the flesh for use in the soup.
- Sauté onion, garlic, ginger (and fresh chilli and lemongrass, if using) in oil on a medium heat
- Add the pumpkin and sauté for a few minutes
- Lower the temperature and add the can of coconut cream
- Fill the can of coconut cream with water, then add that to the pot
- Add sriracha (and you can add more later if it's not spicy enough)
- Simmer on low for as long as you can. The soup should reduce and go a nice dark pumpkiny colour.
- Turn off the heat and fish out the lemongrass if you added it. Blend the soup in the pot with a stick blender, or use whatever blending method you have available.
- If the soup is too thick at this point, add water in 1/2 cup increments until you get the consistency you desire
- Season to taste with salt, pepper, sriracha, and optional coriander
